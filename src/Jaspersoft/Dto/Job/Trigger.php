     *       End time is still honored.
     *   4 - SimpleTrigger is schduled for time after 'now' taking into account any associated Calendar, repeat count
     *       set to what it woudl be had no misfires occurred.
     *   5 - SimpleTrigger scheduled after 'now' taking into account nay associated Calendar,
     *       repeat count left unchanged.
     *
     * __CalendarTrigger Types__
